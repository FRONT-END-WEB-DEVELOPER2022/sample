<h2><i>Benefits of Budgeting</i></h2>
<hr>
<h4 style="font-family:forte; color: red;">Posted on 19th of December in 2019</h4>
<p>
<strong>Benefits 1:</strong> Budgeting helps to know exactly how much you can spend- what your limit is,
so that your can aviod spending to the extent of being left with almost nothing before
your next income. We all know more or less how much our expenses are, as we spend on them every month.So we all
can over-budget a little bit, just to be on the safe side.
<br><strong> Benefit 2:</strong> The other benefit of budgeting is making sure that all your needs are met first.
There is nothing as devastating as spending your money only to find that there are monthly needs
to be taken care of. Such needs like transport to work, church, food, toiletries, electriciaty etc.-
all the things you need throughout the whole month, can't be compromised. They are necessity that cannot
be compromised. Think about how it is to live without such things. i've been there- not pleasant at all.

<h2><i> Ability to stick to the Budget</i></h2>
<hr>
<p>It's one thing to budget, it's another thing to stick to actually stick to it. My oh my! For the past months,
I'll honestly say I did not even try to stick to my budget. Here's why: I did not allocate a specific amount of money
to my expenses, so I couldn't even consciously stick to a certain amount to money as I spent on my needs. As a result,
I ended up spending more than I was supposed to, which meant that the money finished quickly before month end. Not good,
But we learn, right?
<br> So, this month I was off to a great start! I'll share some ways to help you to actually stick to your budget: 
<br><strong>Ability 1:</strong> Once you have estimated and over-budgeted to little for all your needs, keep in mind
the exact amount budgeted for each expense. That way when you go the the shops, you will know how much you can spend and limit
yourself. Watch out for those "buy 2 and get 1 free" promotions.
<br><strong>Ability 2:</strong> If you shop at shops like Pick 'n Pay and Clicks, make sure you get the Smartshopper card, Clicks clubcard-
all these cards that earn you shopping points. Besides the fact that they keep track of what is bought the most so that the items are always on 
stock, they actually help us financially,too.
<br><strong>Ability 3:</strong> Make sure you scratch out what you actually buy from your list, so that when you did not find what you budgeted
for at one shop, you still keep the money budgeted for it, to avoid spending that money. To leave it in the list will keep you alert of the fact 
that you still need to keep money for some needs.
<br><strong>Ability 4:</strong> This is something I mentioned in the prevoius post on this topic: do not rush to finish all the money you saved from
the budget. There are unexpected expenses that you may come across during the month.
<br><strong>Ability 5:</strong> Donot buy what you did not budget for, unless you're buying from the money left if you didn't reach the amount budgeted for.
This one requires discipline! In fact, it should be easy, because you know how much you will struggle if you spend more than budgeted. I learnt it the hard way!
Don't do it! And it's normal to actually borrow money, but the corcern about that is you are already not earning enough.
