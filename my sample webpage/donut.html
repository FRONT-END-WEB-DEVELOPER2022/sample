<p>A donut is a type of <strong class="warning"> deep fried </strong> dough confectionery
or dessert food. The doughnut is popular in many countries and prepared in various forms 
as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls,
and franchised specialty outlets.
</p>
<p class="fact warning">Did you know? Donut can also be spelled "doughnut"
</p>
<p>The two most common types are the <strong> toroidal ring doughnut</strong> and the <strong>
filled doughnut</strong>-which is injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet
fillings. A small spherical piece of dough may be cooked as a doughnut hole. Other shapes include
rings, balls, and flattened spheres, as well as ear shapes, twists and other forms. 
Doughnut varieties are also divided into cake and risen type doughnuts.
